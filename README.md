##Projects and Descriptions

1. Room temperature and lighting control using the Atmega16 microcontroller

Never tested on an actual hardwared but has been tested a number of times on [proteus VSM](https://www.labcenter.com/simulation/) 7.6.
Development was done on Windows but should be easily ported to Linux via the AVR GCC toolset.
